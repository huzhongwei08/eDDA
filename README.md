# eDDA
Electron-driven discrete dipole approximation (e-DDA) source code.

This code is based on [DDSCAT 7.1](http://ddscat.wikidot.com/) and originally developed by Bigelow and co-workers under the guidance of [Prof. Masiello](https://faculty.washington.edu/masiello/Masiello_Group_Website/Home.html) from University of Washington. See [publications](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn302980u, https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn401161n). Hu and co-workers made it more rubust in 2019, see [publication](https://journals.aps.org/prb/accepted/e307cO75Ze81aa39655353a7bef9237196137f2fe.)

To compile it, simply do
```console
make veryclean; make all
```

Please refer to the [user manual](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.1505.pdf) for how-to.
